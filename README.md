# Research Assistant

A research assistant that searches, downloads, embeds, summarizes, and queries research papers from arXiv and existing papers on your computer. No APIs. Leverages locally downloaded models using the OpenVINO library for searching arXiv, chatting with papers, and generating embeddings.

Works best on Intel CPU/GPU. Only CPU support for ARM platforms (no GPU).
